This app will be the foundation model for QyrouNnet-App.
future updates will contain:
- official QyrouNnet-LM
- official Project-Luca integrations
- complete eco-system around ollama
- complete ecosystem around Qyrou-Lab AI models (my AI models)
- tool addons by user
- community plugins

right now, the app is under development.
And, I am planning to release an Alpha release to test out the app as soon as possible.


  Also, expect the app to have embedding models to embed specialized database imported from hugging face to search information locally just like how chatgpt searches the web using a cleaned and properly formated form of Wikipedia created by me, using DaSy-XBp.
  that will include synthetic-true data inbetween to fill out important data which was missed when filtering data.
